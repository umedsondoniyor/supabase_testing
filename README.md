# supabase_testing
I'm testing supabase plus another love code platforms code wich is code2/IcodeBetter

Also refactoring some codes in VSCode beacause it's not quite comfortable refactoring code. Due to small screens/tabs of coding in low code platform it's
better to refactore/code in VSCode or any other editor rather than coding in low code env.
